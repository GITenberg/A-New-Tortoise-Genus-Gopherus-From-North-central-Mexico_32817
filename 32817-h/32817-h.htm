<br>
In the course of taxonomic studies of the genus
<i>
Gopherus
</i>
it was found that specimens from north-central Mexico belong to an hitherto unrecognized species, which is named and described below.
</p>
<p class="head">
<b>
Gopherus flavomarginatus

new species
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>
Holotype.</i>&#8212;U.S. National Museum 61253, adult; stuffed specimen with disassociated skull; 30 to 40 miles from Lerdo, Durango, Mexico; obtained by Dr. Elswood Chaffee, 1918.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Paratypes.</i>&#8212;USNM 61254, adult, stuffed specimen with skull in place, other data the same as those for holotype; USNM 60976, adult, stuffed specimen with disassociated skull, Lerdo, Durango, Dr. Elswood Chaffee, May 1918; University of Illinois 42953-4, adults, two carapaces, Carrillo, Chihuahua, Pete S. Chrapliwy and Kenneth L. Williams, 1 August 1958; University of Kansas 39415, adult, carapace only, 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos, Coahuila, Robert W. Dickerman, 19 May 1954.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Diagnosis.</i>&#8212;A large tortoise of the genus
<i>
Gopherus</i>, having a flat-topped, posteriorly-flared shell, carapacal laminae that are pale with contrasting dark centers (at least on the lateral margins of the carapace), intergular seam longer than interhumeral, obtuse gular projections, and a relatively wider skull than other Mexican representatives of the genus.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Description of species.</i>&#8212;Ground color of carapace pale yellow to straw in smaller specimens, pale brown in larger specimens; in some specimens a slight indication of darker radial markings on carapace; epidermal areolae of carapace (if present) and first two or three zones of growth (around areolae) dark brown to black, their contrast with the ground color greater in smaller specimens; ground color of lateral marginals yellowish, much paler than remainder of carapace; black areolae of marginals contrasting sharply with ground color even in old individuals; plastron pale, approximately the same shade of yellow as lateral marginals, marked with sharply contrasting blotches of black or dark brown in younger specimens, becoming immaculate with age.
</p>
<p>
Carapace low, evenly arched or slightly flat-topped in cross section, its height slightly more than 50 per cent of its length; top of carapace, between highest parts of first and fourth central laminae, more or less flat in profile; carapace flared, wider posteriorly than anteriorly; central laminae all broader than long, the first not (or but slightly) narrower posteriorly than anteriorly; plastron deeply notched behind, the inner margins of the notch straight, neither convex nor concave; gular projections truncate (not pronglike) having no notch or but a shallow notch between them; greatest combined width of gular laminae much greater than greatest length; interlaminal length of gular greater than that of humeral; one large axillary scute on each side, approximately rectangular but slightly wider below than above; one or two inguinal scutes on each side, the anterior roughly triangular and much larger than posterior.
</p>
<p>
Anterior surface of antebrachium having enlarged, juxtaposed (or slightly imbricated), osteodermal scales arranged in seven to eight longitudinal rows, each scale yellowish with a black or dark brown center; scales on lateral edge of antebrachium, from fifth claw to elbow, ten in number and darker than other antebrachial scales; two enlarged black-tipped, yellow spurs on posterior surface of thigh, inner spur approximately half the size of outer. Head relatively wide, greatest width of skull slightly more than 80 per cent of condylobasilar length; width of head 1.3 to 1.7 times diameter of hind foot; scales on top of head large but irregularly arranged (see table 1 for measurements of type and paratypes).

Duges (1888:146-147, and 1896:479) twice reported specimens of
<i>
Gopherus polyphemus
</i>
from Chihuahua (see discussion of distribution); his description of two living examples (1888) agrees generally with the above description of
<i>
G. flavomarginatus</i>. He stated that the iris of his smaller specimen was yellow and the iris of a larger specimen brown.
</p>
<p>
It will be most interesting to learn the color of juveniles of
<i>
G. flavomarginatus</i>. Considering the dark color of the epidermal areolae of adults, I would expect the color of hatchlings to be dark brown to nearly black, with each lamina acquiring paler borders as it grew, rather than acquiring darker borders as is usually the case in
<i>
G. berlandieri
</i>
(personal observation),
<i>
agassizii
</i>
(Miller, 1932:194, pl. 2; Woodbury and Hardy, 1948:165, figs. 9 and 10), and
<i>
polyphemus
</i>
(personal observation).

<span class="above">
2</span><small>/</small><span class="below">5</span>).
</p>
<p>
<i>
Anomalies.</i>&#8212;There is a high incidence of anomaly in the type series. Three of the specimens (USNM 60976, IU 42954, and KU 39415) have a supernumerary central lamina. All of the specimens from Durango are anomalous in regard to the marginal laminae. In the holotype the first marginals are small, approximately as wide as the small precentral. In the largest paratype (USNM 61254) the first and second marginals are fused to form a single large scute on each side. In the remaining Durangan paratype (USNM 60976) there are eleven normal marginals on each side but a supernumerary lamina occurs between the first and second marginal on the left and between the precentral and first marginal on the right side. The remaining three paratypes have the number of marginals that is normal for the genus.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Relationships.</i>&#8212;<i>Gopherus flavomarginatus
</i>
differs from all other species of the genus by its larger size and by having an intergular seam that is longer than the interhumeral seam. The possession of a single, rectangular axillary scale, wider below than above, also tends to distinguish
<i>
flavomarginatus
</i>
from other living
<i>
Gopherus</i>; in the other species this scute (frequently paired in
<i>
berlandieri</i>) is generally triangular or at least pointed below. Femoral spurs are developed to varying degrees in the other species of
<i>
Gopherus</i>; they are usually lacking in individuals of small to medium size. In large specimens of
<i>
agassizii
</i>
and
<i>
polyphemus
</i>
that I have examined, there is but one enlarged spur, although several pointed osteodermal scales may be present on the back of the thigh.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Gopherus berlandieri</i>, the closest relative of
<i>
G. flavomarginatus
</i>
in a geographic sense, has a highly arched shell and pronglike gular projections, between which there is nearly always a deep notch.
<i>
Gopherus agassizii</i>, morphologically the closest Mexican relative of
<i>
flavomarginatus</i>, differs from it in having a narrower head and in lacking the contrasting pale and dark coloration of the plastron and lateral marginal area.
<i>
Gopherus polyphemus
</i>
seems to be the closest relative of
<i>
flavomarginatus
</i>
and differs from it in having an unflared shell (anterior and posterior widths of carapace subequal or carapace narrower behind) and in the characteristics of color mentioned above. Certain proportional differences between the living species of
<i>
Gopherus
</i>
are summarized in table 2.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Distribution.</i>&#8212;The discovery of a new
<i>
Gopherus
</i>
from north-central Mexico increases to four the recognized forms of the genus and extends the known range of the genus onto the Mexican highlands, approximately 410 miles eastward from Alamos, Sonora (<i>G. agassizii</i>), approximately 100 miles westward from a point 2 mi. W of Monclova, Coahuila (<i>G. berlandieri</i>), and approximately 200 miles westward from Monterrey, Nuevo Le&#243;n (<i>G. berlandieri</i>).

Thus far,
<i>
G. flavomarginatus
</i>
is known only from the three localities represented in the type series and from the indefinite locality, "Bolson de Mapim&#237;", Chihuahua, given by Duges (1888:146-7, and 1896:479). These long-doubted references of Duges to
<i>
Gopherus polyphemus
</i>
seem clearly to represent
<i>
G. flavomarginatus</i>, which probably occurs in several or all of the internally drained basins in northeastern Chihuahua, western Coahuila, and northern Durango. This region is within the Basin and Range physiographic province of Fenneman (1931:326-8) and the Mapim&#237; biotic province of Smith (1949:231). Duges (<i>supra cit.</i>) seems to have used "Bolson de Mapim&#237;" in a restricted sense, as it is shown on some recent maps (Nat. Geog. Soc., Map of Mexico and Central America, 1953) (American Geog. Soc., Culican Map, NG 13, 1935). Other maps show this bolson to include internally drained portions of the Mexican highlands from northeastern Chihuahua to the region near Lerdo and Torreon. Thayer (1916:73) pointed out that the Bolson de Mapim&#237;, in its larger sense, consists of a series of basins separated by mountains of considerable elevation.
</p>
<p>
The range of
<i>
G. flavomarginatus
</i>
appears to be limited ultimately by the higher elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Sierra Madre Oriental to the west and east, respectively, and to the south by the Mexican plateau. The northern limits of the range are less clear; possibly the range extends as far as the portions of the United States adjacent to northeastern Chihuahua, but this is doubtful. The range seems not to overlap that of any other species of
<i>
Gopherus</i>, although the ranges of
<i>
G. flavomarginatus
</i>
and
<i>
G. berlandieri
</i>
closely approximate each other in central Coahuila.
</p>
<p>
In September, 1958, when I was collecting turtles near Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, I took the opportunity to query natives, as well as an American rancher, about the possible occurrence of tortoises in the area. Most persons had seen no tortoises in the area or said they had seen them only rarely. Several older men who had herded goats in the area all their lives said that tortoises (referred to as "Tortuga del Monte") were common on the other side of the Sierra de La Madera and Sierra de La Fragua ranges west of Cuatro Cienegas. These men referred probably to
<i>
G. flavomarginatus</i>. Americanos lies approximately 75 miles west-northwest of Cuatro Cienegas.
</p>
<p>
It is indeed remarkable that a population of large tortoises in northern Mexico has so long escaped the notice of naturalists. Also remarkable is the fact that the late Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, in view of his intense interest in North American chelonians and his familiarity with the genus
<i>
Gopherus</i>, did not remark on the specimens from Durango when he saw them; a thorough search of Stejneger's notes revealed no clue that he had ever studied the specimens. Perhaps his first reaction to the specimens, like mine when I first examined the two disassociated skulls, was to consider "Lerdo" a misspelling of "Laredo." However, a check of old correspondence and accession records at the National Museum confirmed, beyond doubt, the validity of the locality data for these specimens. Dr. Chaffee, the collector, frequently sent specimens of plants and animals to the Museum from Durango and Zacatecas; his home was in Lerdo.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Size.</i>&#8212;The largest specimen of
<i>
Gopherus flavomarginatus
</i>
(USNM 61254) exceeds by more than 50 millimeters the length of the largest known specimens of
<i>
G. agassizii</i>, and slightly exceeds the length of the largest specimen of
<i>
G. polyphemus
</i>
that I have examined (USNM 51357, length of carapace 360 millimeters, a specimen formerly kept at the National Zoological Park).
<i>
G. polyphemus
</i>
is the largest tortoise inhabiting the United States; the maximum length of 343 millimeters given for the species by Carr (1952:334) probably more closely approaches the true maximum in free-living populations.
<i>
G. agassizii
</i>
rarely attains a length greater than 300 millimeters (Woodbury and Hardy, 1948:152-5). The fact that representatives of the genus do not attain a larger size in the United States may be due to the decimation of natural populations by man for food and souvenirs.
</p>
<p>
There have been several indications that a large species of tortoise existed in north-central Mexico. The Chihuahuan specimens reported by Duges (248 and 202 millimeters long, respectively) rank in size with the smaller paratypes of
<i>
G. flavomarginatus</i>; Duges stated, however, that the species was said to attain a length of one meter but that he thought such large size surely to apply to another species.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Charles M. Bogert recently related to me two stories that are here worthy of note. One of them, which Bogert learned from the late Dr. Karl P. Schmidt, concerns a collector who was sent by the Chicago Natural History Museum (then Field Museum) to Coahuila in the early part of the century to obtain materials for a desert exhibit. When the exhibit had been completed several decades later, the collector, visiting the museum, inquired as to where the large tortoises were that he had collected in Coahuila. Dr. Schmidt could find no record of such tortoises and suggested that possibly they had been confused with Galapagos tortoises (<i>Geochelone</i>). Dr. Robert F. Inger is unable to locate the specimens or add anything to the story. The collector stated that the large tortoises had been found in only one bolson in Coahuila.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bogert further related that, in 1946 when he was camped at Las Delicias, Coahuila, a Mexican mule herder told him of seeing a large tortoise "three bolsons north" of the bolson in which Las Delicias is located (the general area referred to would be near Americanos). The man awoke one morning to find his saddle missing; following tracks from the place where the saddle had been left, the man eventually found it on the back of a large tortoise. The tortoise had apparently sought shelter beneath the saddle and, finding it unsatisfactory, had walked away with the saddle on his back.
</p>
<p>
Either of the incidents related above, or the reference of Duges (<i>loc. cit.</i>) to large size, since they are based on second or third-hand accounts, would seem to be unrealistic and of little scientific value when considered alone and at face value. However, in the light of the discovery of
<i>
Gopherus flavomarginatus</i>, these accounts have new meaning and tend to support my proposal that the species is the largest tortoise in North America.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Remarks.</i>&#8212;The paratypes at the University of Illinois were found in a trash-dump in Carrillo. According to what the collectors learned from local inhabitants, the species is used for food and the shells are sometimes used for poultry dishes or even for eating utensils. Although the species is found on the flat, sandy desert near Carrillo, it is more common on the nearby mountain slopes and is seen there most frequently after rains. Dickerman (field notes, 1954) likewise noted that the species was eaten near Americanos; the K.U. paratype represents the best (and only specimen saved) of several broken shells found in that area. Judging by the habits of other members of the genus and by the notes of Duges (1888:147),
<i>
G. flavomarginatus
</i>
is probably herbivorous.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Acknowledgments.</i>&#8212;A portion of this study was completed in the summer of 1958, while I was an internee at the United States National Museum. I am grateful to Dr. Doris M. Cochran of that institution for helpful information regarding the origin of the type and for permission to study other specimens in her care. Thanks are due also to Messrs. Pete S. Chrapliwy and Kenneth L. Williams who collected two of the paratypes and who generously provided their notes on the specimens when learning of my study, to Dr. Hobart M. Smith and Mr. Charles M. Bogert for offering helpful suggestions and for the loan of specimens, and to Mr. Jebb Taylor for assistance with taking data. The drawings are the work of Mrs. Connie Spitz; the photographs are by the author.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
